# About Me

I'm a Software Engineer with over **9 years of experience** in building scalable IT solutions across **cloud platforms (AWS & GCP)**, **AI/ML applications**, and **test automation frameworks**.

**What I love doing**:
- Developing LLM-powered applications with RAG architecture
- Designing predictive ML models for energy forecasting and anomaly detection
- Building automation frameworks for embedded and mobile UI testing
- Architecting data lake solutions using AWS Glue, BigQuery, and Dataflow

Driven by curiosity and passion for innovation, I enjoy solving real-world problems using clean code and smart design.
