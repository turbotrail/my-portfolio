We often design for **heat**, **vibration**, **EMI**, or **power surges** — but what about **geomagnetic storms**?

A **geomagnetic storm** is a large-scale disturbance of Earth’s magnetic field, triggered by solar flares or coronal mass ejections (CMEs). When high-energy charged particles from the Sun hit our magnetosphere, they can induce powerful currents and electromagnetic effects.

### 🎯 Why this matters to us in tech:
- 🔹 **Satellite Systems**: GPS, communications, and observation satellites face single-event upsets and orbital drag issues
- 🔹 **Power Grids**: Geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can stress transformers and cause major blackouts
- 🔹 **Aviation & Navigation**: Polar flight routes and GNSS accuracy can be heavily impacted
- 🔹 **Pipelines & Subsea Cables**: Even underground infrastructure can suffer corrosion and current imbalance

As we move deeper into IoT, space systems, AI navigation, and satellite constellations, **space weather resilience** becomes mission-critical.  
The systems we build won’t just need to be fault-tolerant — they’ll need to be *space-aware*. ☀️

Let’s start designing with the Sun in mind. 🌍  
Curious how this ties into what you’re building? Happy to connect and discuss!
